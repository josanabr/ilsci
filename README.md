Tutorial of Rapid Provisioning Tools
====================================
Introduction
------------
This repository contains different examples to intend to help you in the process of learning how to use different tools used in provisioning scenarios such as Vagrant, Chef and Ansible.

This repository will be modified in a weekly basis in order to incorporate new examples to help the student to grasp the concepts related with provisioning of high performance computational infrastructures.
Some topics that will be taught during the semester are:
* Using Vagrant for rapid VM creation
* Deploying a Web Server
* Deploying computational clusters
	* OpenMPI
	* HTCondor
	* Hadoop

Installing the Provisioning Tools
---------------------------------
You can run the examples provided in this repository in your own computer or laptop. 
The following tools are needed:

* Vagrant
* Ansible

### Installing Vagrant
Vagrant is a program used to create Virtual Machines (VMs) for different hypervisors and cloud providers such as VMWare, VirtualBox and Amazon. 
In this course you will use VirtualBox 4.2.x and Vagrant 1.6.x. 
Then you need to download VirtualBox (use this [link](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_4_2)) and Vagrant (use this [link](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)).

Interacting with Vagrant
------------------------
In the following subsections you will find different exercises to let you understand about how you can use the provisioning tools taught in this course.
